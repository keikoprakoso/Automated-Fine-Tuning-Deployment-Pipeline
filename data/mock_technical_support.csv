"How do I fix a blue screen error on Windows?","To fix a blue screen error on Windows, first restart your computer. If the error persists, boot into Safe Mode by pressing F8 during startup. Check for recent software installations or updates that might have caused the issue. Update your device drivers, especially graphics and storage drivers. Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool to check for RAM issues. If problems continue, use System Restore to revert to a previous stable state, or consider a clean Windows installation as a last resort."
"What causes high CPU usage and how do I reduce it?","High CPU usage can be caused by background processes, malware, insufficient RAM, or software bugs. To reduce it, open Task Manager (Ctrl+Shift+Esc) and identify which processes are using the most CPU. Close unnecessary applications and browser tabs. Disable startup programs you don't need. Update your software and drivers. Scan for malware using Windows Defender or third-party antivirus. If the issue persists, consider upgrading your RAM or checking for hardware issues."
"How do I recover deleted files from my computer?","To recover deleted files, first check the Recycle Bin. If not there, stop using the drive immediately to prevent overwriting. Use built-in Windows File History if enabled, or try the Previous Versions feature. For more thorough recovery, use data recovery software like Recuva, TestDisk, or professional tools. Connect the drive to another computer if possible. For critical data, consider professional data recovery services. Always maintain regular backups to prevent future data loss."
"What's the difference between RAM and storage?","RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary, fast memory that stores data while your computer is running. It's volatile, meaning data is lost when power is turned off. Storage (HDD/SSD) is permanent memory that holds your files, programs, and operating system even when powered off. RAM is much faster but more expensive per gigabyte. You need both: RAM for active programs and storage for long-term data. More RAM improves multitasking and performance, while more storage gives you space for files."
"How do I troubleshoot slow internet connection?","To troubleshoot slow internet, first test your speed using speedtest.net. Restart your modem and router. Check for interference from other devices or networks. Move closer to your router if using Wi-Fi. Update your router firmware. Check for background downloads or updates. Contact your ISP if speeds are consistently below what you're paying for. Consider upgrading your plan or switching providers if the issue persists."
"How do I set up a VPN connection?","To set up a VPN, first choose a VPN service provider and create an account. Download and install the VPN client software. Launch the application and sign in with your credentials. Select a server location (choose one close to you for better speed). Click connect to establish the VPN tunnel. Verify your connection by checking your IP address. For manual setup, use Windows built-in VPN settings or configure OpenVPN. Always use reputable VPN providers for security."
"How do I clean malware from my computer?","To clean malware, first disconnect from the internet to prevent further infection. Boot into Safe Mode if possible. Run a full system scan with Windows Defender or your antivirus software. Use additional malware removal tools like Malwarebytes or HitmanPro. Update your operating system and all software. Change passwords for important accounts. If the infection is severe, consider a clean system reinstall. Always keep your security software updated and be cautious with downloads."
"What causes computer overheating and how do I fix it?","Computer overheating is caused by dust buildup, poor ventilation, failing fans, or heavy workloads. To fix it, clean dust from vents and fans using compressed air. Ensure proper airflow around your computer. Check that all fans are working properly. Replace thermal paste on the CPU if needed. Close unnecessary programs to reduce load. Use a laptop cooling pad if applicable. If problems persist, check for hardware issues or consider professional cleaning."
"How do I encrypt my hard drive?","To encrypt your hard drive, use BitLocker on Windows (available in Pro/Enterprise editions). Go to Control Panel > System and Security > BitLocker Drive Encryption. Select the drive to encrypt and follow the setup wizard. Choose between password or smart card authentication. Save your recovery key in a safe location. For other operating systems, use FileVault (macOS) or LUKS (Linux). Encryption protects your data if your device is lost or stolen."
"How do I optimize my computer for gaming?","To optimize your computer for gaming, update your graphics drivers to the latest version. Close unnecessary background programs and disable startup items. Adjust Windows power settings to 'High Performance'. Update your operating system and game software. Consider upgrading RAM if you have less than 16GB. Use an SSD for faster loading times. Adjust in-game graphics settings to balance performance and quality. Monitor temperatures to prevent thermal throttling."
