Customer: I enter my email and password, but it says 'invalid credentials'. Assistant: I understand the frustration. Let's troubleshoot this step by step. First, can you confirm you're using the correct email address? Also, make sure caps lock is off when entering your password. Customer: Yes, I'm sure about the email. Should I try resetting my password? Assistant: That's a good idea! Let's try a password reset first. I'll send you a reset link to your email address. You should receive it within a few minutes.

If you still have issues after resetting your password, please let me know and I'll help you further."
